This repo is my notes on **learning and practicing SysML**. It contains a [road map](./map.md) which includes awesome [papers](./papers), [courses](./courses), [videos](./videos), [opensource frameworks](./frameworks/), [basic concepts in Machine Learning collected here](./concepts.md). You'd better **watch** this repo to receive notification when I push new commits.

I want to [became an expert on SysML in 3-5 years](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/384089714), so I will record every step on my way to achieve this goal.
