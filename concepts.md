[Embedding](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/embeddings/video-lecture): An embedding is a relatively low-dimensional space into which you can translate high-dimensional vectors. It caputres some of the semantics of the input by placing **semantically similar inputs close together** in the embedding space. An embedding can be learned an reused across models. 从一个空间映射到一个向量空间里，而且具备相似的输入距离更近的特点。
